// Remembering that a binding holds relics, so only the first process pays to
// find out.
//
// The boot census lists the binding with AllowScan and IncludeClosed, so it
// costs the binding's whole history rather than its working set, and the
// one-shot CLI funnel pays it per process — in front of `gc bd`'s by-id door,
// the busiest one-shot route there is. Measured on a real sqlite binding
// (internal/storeref/relic_census_bench_test.go): 7ms at 1k rows, 82ms at 10k,
// linear in rows. A city with a year of graph history pays that before it
// answers anything.
//
// Only the TRUE verdict is remembered, and that asymmetry is the whole design.
// Nothing ever deletes a relic — `gc storage migrate` copies rows across under
// their original ids and never deletes the source — so "this binding has held a
// resident" is MONOTONE and cannot go stale. A remembered FALSE is the opposite:
// it would have to stay true about the future, and the only thing that can
// falsify it (a migration into a binding this city already serves) can run from
// another build that has never heard of this file. So a clean binding is
// censused live, every process, forever.
//
// That leaves this note unable to lose a bead in any direction. A stale entry —
// an operator who rebuilt the binding from scratch, say — keeps a probe alive
// that could have retired: the reads stay correct and cost one extra leg. An
// absent or corrupt note costs a scan. Nothing here can retire a probe the
// census would have kept.
